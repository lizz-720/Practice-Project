# Practice-Project

This repository now contains a minimal ASP.NET Core application to show what the project looks like as a runnable app.

## Run the application

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Endpoints

- `GET /` returns a plain-text confirmation message.
- `GET /health` returns a JSON health payload.
